The Python script metrology_analytics.py connects to a Snowflake account to perform a series of database operations.
The main purpose of the script is to simulate the ingestion and analysis of metrology data, from a manufacturing process like semiconductor fabrication.
The script interacts with Snowflake to perform four main actions: establish a connection, set the session context, manage a table, and run an analytical query.
